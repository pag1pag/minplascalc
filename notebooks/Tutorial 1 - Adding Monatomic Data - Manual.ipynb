You only need to do this <i>once</i> - minplascalc will store the species data in a plain-text file formatted using JSON syntax, and it will then be available for use in any of your future calculations.\n",

    "What's happening here? First we import the minplascalc package, then we read the energy levels from the NIST data file (converting to J), then we create a `Monatomic` species object, and finally we save the contents to a data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Monatomic` class constructor takes as arguments the species name, a small dictionary describing the elemental stoichiometry of the species (in this case a single oxygen atom), the molar mass in kg/mol, the charge on the species in units of the fundamental charge (in this case 1 because O<sup>+</sup> is singly charged), the ionisation energy of the species in J, a list of length-2 lists describing the energy levels (degeneracy and energy in J of each level respectively), and a list of data sources for referencing. The object can be written out to disk using the Species object's `to_file` utility function, which saves data to a JSON-formatted file. It takes an optional file path argument - if omitted, the filename is created using the species' name and written to the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this process it will be possible to create an O<sup>+</sup> species object in any minplascalc calculation by importing it using either the explicit path to the JSON file, or (preferably) just the name of the species provided the JSON file is stored in any of the standard minplascalc data paths - see later tutorials for examples."
